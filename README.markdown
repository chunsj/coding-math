Working through <https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath/videos> in Common Lisp
with [Sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch).

I'm finished with all 50 episodes (I only skipped a few that contained no coding
or didn't work with Sketch), so this repo will no longer be updated.

If you want to see how I did a particular episode you should look in the commit
log, because I overwrote the same file each time instead of trying to maintain
old versions of everything along the way.
